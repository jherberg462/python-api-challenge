# It appears to be warmer today in the South Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere

Without applying any existing knowledge about the weather, I would conclude it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere in late October. This is based on the fact that temperatures appear to be higher in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere after accounting for distance from the equator (0 latitude). 

The highest temperatures are their highest near the equator, and generally trend down the further they are from the equator. 

# Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed do not appear to be affected by latitude

There is no apparent correlation between latitude, and Humidity, Cloudiness, nor wind speed as of late October. All of this data appears to be more or less randomly spread among the plots. 

# There are a larger number of cities in the Northern Hemisphere than in the South Hemisphere 

There appear to be more cities above the equator than below the equator based on the random sample of cities. The Northern Hemisphere also has more cities that are closer to the North Pole than the Southern Hemisphere has cities near the South Pole.
